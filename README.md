🌐 Smart Wheelchair using IoT 📡
Excited to share my latest project, " Smart Wheelchair" leveraging the power of Internet of Things (IoT) and built with NodeMCU! 🚀

The Smart Wheelchair project is an innovative solution that enhances the accessibility and functionality of traditional wheelchairs. By integrating IoT capabilities and the NodeMCU with Blynk application, I have created a wheelchair that offers advanced features for improved user experience and safety.

🔹 Key Features:
✨ Remote Control: The wheelchair can be remotely controlled using a application, providing convenient mobility for individuals with limited physical abilities.
✨ Safety Mechanisms: Intelligent safety mechanisms like collision detection, obstacle avoidance, and emergency stop functionality have been implemented, ensuring the well-being of the user and preventing accidents.
